PlayerRoundHand:
    GT Hand: Hand
    Hand Pre exch: Hand
    exch_call_pos_round_score: 8 Byte (Lower 36 bits: Exchange cards, 8 Bit PlayerCalls, 2 Bit PlayerIdent, 8 Bit PlayerRanks, 8 Bit CardScore, )
    => 24 Byte
    fn weggeschupft -> Hand
    fn zugeschupft -> Hand
    fn hand_post_exch -> Hand
Round:
 4 PlayerRoundHands 24 Bytes each
 => 96 Bytes per round

 Game:
    Vec<Round>
    Vec<RoundLog>
    playerid: 2 Byte each

    160 Byte* rounds + 8 Byte
    => Around 3.37 GB (should implement serialization/de-serialization).
 TaggedCardIndex: 2 Bits Player(Or Bomb Or NewTrick), 6 Bits CardIndex
    fn get_player, fn get_card_index -> Trait again 
 RoundLog:
    Vec<TaggedCardIndex: u8> -> 56 Byte per Round + some
